                <p>Interesting facts: Welch was the oldest of three children in an upper-middle-class family in south London. Her father was a British advertising executive whose fondness for punk informed some of Welch's earliest musical memories. Her mother, an American professor of Renaissance studies, exposed Welch to the art and music of that era.</p>

                <p>How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful is the third studio album by the English indie rock band Florence and the Machine, released on 29 May 2015 by Island Records. After her year-long break from music, the lead vocalist, Florence Welch, returned to configure the album, recording material that dealt with personal conflicts and struggles. In comparison to the band's two previous studio albums, it is much more refined and stripped-down instrumentally, and incorporates a mixture of musical influences such as folk, blues and gospel.

                How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful was met with positive reviews from music critics, who commended the album for its cohesion, production and Welch's vocal delivery. It appeared on several year-end critics' lists. The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number one with 68,788 copies sold in its first week, becoming the band's third consecutive number-one album. Four singles were released, "What Kind of Man", "Ship to Wreck", "Queen of Peace" and "Delilah". The album earned the band five Grammy Award nominations, in addition to being shortlisted for the 2015 Mercury Prize.</p>

                <h2>Florence Welch Reveals Recent 'Emergency' Surgery: 'It Saved My Life'</h2> <!--This is an article-->
                <p>Florence Welch revealed that she recently underwent “emergency” surgery that "saved [her] life" in a note to fans explaining a string of recently-canceled Florence and the Machine concerts.

                Welch didn't specify what the surgery was, or the risk she was facing, saying only: "I'm so sorry that I had to cancel the last couple shows. My feet are fine, I had to have emergency surgery for reasons I don't really feel strong enough to go into yet, but it saved my life." (The remark about her feet is ostensibly a nod to a broken foot she suffered on stage last year, which caused Florence and the Machine to postpone their U.K. tour.)
                
                Welch continued: "Suffice to say I wish the songs were less accurate in their predictions. But creativity is a way of coping, mythology is [a] way of making sense. And the dark fairytale of Dance Fever, with all its strange prophecies, will provide me with much needed strength and catharsis right now."

            <dd>The song was released on 12 February 2015 as the album's lead single. According to Florence Welch, the song represents a new guitar-driven sonic direction for the band. "It's got very loud guitars and that was very fun to record actually", she said in an interview. "Trying to get exactly the right tone of guitar—I never realised how complicated that is. It took us forever.... Every day there'd be a different guitar sound. We ended up layering with three different guitar sounds, one on top of the other, in order to create this one song."</dd> <!--Description definition tag-->
            <dt><b style="color:rgb(33, 33, 219); background-color: yellow;">"Ship To Wreck"</b></dt>
            <dd>The song was released on 9 April 2015 as the album's second single. In a press release, Welch explained the meaning behind the song, saying: "I was thinking about my own self destructive side, and how you can make something only to tear it down, enjoy/destroy, create/devastate etc. When you're in that whirlwind, you often end up breaking the thing you love the most."</dd>
            <dt><b style="color:rgb(48, 93, 207); background-color: yellow;">"Queen Of Peace"</b></dt>
            <dd>The song was released on 4 September 2015 as the album's third single. On the face of it, this song details the bittersweet victory of a king and queen in a battle who despite winning, lost their son in the conflict. However, it seems Welch is comparing the royal anguish to her suffering in the relationship that is driving her away</dd>
            <dt><b style="color:rgb(87, 136, 239); background-color: yellow;">"Delilah"</b></dt>
            <dd>The song was released on 27 November 2015 as the album's fourth and final single. The music video for this song was directed by Vincent Haycock: "The cutting of the hair was a direct reference to the biblical [story of] Delilah, but then it veered off into something more personal to Florence. Since this song was always planned as being the end of the series, we decided to make it about [her] returning to her true self, killing off the ego version of herself, and finding her way home again."</dd>

Good God, under starless skies we are lost,
And into the breach we got tossed,
And the water's coming in fast!

And oh my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me, to make my bed

I was on a heavy tip
Tryna cross a canyon with a broken limb
You were on the other side
Like always, wondering what to do with life
I'd already had a sip
So I'd reasoned I <span style="background-color: rgba(3, 132, 225, 0.468);">was drunk enough to deal with it
You were on the other side
Like always, you could never make your mind</span>

And with one kiss
You inspired a fire of devotion
That lasts for twenty years
What kind of man loves like this?

To let me dangle at a cruel angle
Oh my feet don't touch the floor
Sometimes you're half in and then you're half out
But you never close the door

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

You're a holy fool all colored blue
Red feet upon the floor
You do such damage, how do you manage
To have me crawling back for more?
       
And with one kiss
And with one kiss
You inspired a <div style="background-color: rgb(98, 224, 240);">fire of devotion <!--Takes the text out of the line into the block-->

How do you do it? I think I'm through it
Then I'm back against the wall
Back, back, back against the wall

I'm drifting through the halls with the sunrise
(Holding on for your call)
Climbing up the walls for that flashing light
(I can never let go)

Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(Holding on for your call)
Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(Maybe not tonight)

Now the sun is up and I'm going blind
(Holding on for your call)
Another drink just to pass the time
(I can never say no)

It's a different kind of danger
And the bells are ringing out
And I'm calling for my mother
As I pull the pillars down
It's a different kind of danger
And my feet are spinning around
Never knew I was a dancer
'Till Delilah showed me how

Too fast for freedom
Sometimes it all falls down
These chains never leave me
I keep dragging them around

Now I'm dancing with Delilah and her vision is mine
(Holding on for your call)
A different kind of danger in the daylight
(I can never let go)
Took anything to cut you, I can find
(Holding on for your call)
A different kind of a danger in the daylight
(Can't you let me know?)

Now it's one more boy and it's one more lie
(Holding on for your call)
Taking the pills just to pass the time
(I can never say no)

Strung up, strung out for your love
Hang in, hung up, it's so rough
I'm wrung and ringing out
Why can't you let me know?

Too fast for freedom
Sometimes it all falls down
These chains never leave me
I keep dragging them around
