Any time the server is off, cd to the project folder and run "npm run dev" in the terminal

"node_modules" folder contains external libraries, packages that the project relies on, a few of
which are built tools, utility libraries, etc.

"public" folder contains any public assets (public fonts, images, videos, etc.) typically 
available via URL. They are not bundled by the final output

"src" folder contains "assets" folders (images, videos, etc.), which is similar to "public",
but files're bundled during the final output. 
.jsx is JS XML. In a way, main.jsx is a main JS file. React works with components. We add
single components. The "<App />" component, which we import.
The app component in "App.jsx" file is the root component.
We've got 2 CSS files: "App.css" and "index.css" (the latter is the main for the application),
which we import from "main.jsx". App components may have their CSS, but we'll delete "App.css"

"index.html" (main entry point to the program). Within <body> we have "<div id="root"></div>"
element as well as a script to the "main.jsx".

"package.json" file contains metadata about the project. 

Within "App.jsx" remove the code within "App()" and all the imports above to start the project.
We'll add other components to the "App()" component. To create a new component create within
"src" folder a new file (e.g. "Header.jsx"). Head to this file and "App.jsx" for further instructions
