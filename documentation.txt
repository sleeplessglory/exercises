In order to have your code documented install JSDoc:
1. npm install -g jsdoc (globally)
2. npm install docdash --save-dev (a theme for a doc, look for other options too)
3. create "jsdoc.json" file in the root folder of a project.
4. set in that file:
{
    "plugins": ["plugins/markdown"],
    "source": {
        "include": ["src"],
        "exclude": ["node_modules", "cypress"],
        "includePattern": ".+\\.js(doc|x)?$"
    },
    "opts": {
        "template": "node_modules/docdash",
        "destination": "./documentation/developer"
    },
    "docdash": {
	"sort": true,
	"search": true,
	"collapse": false
    }
}
5. npx jsdoc -c jsdoc.json
6. the main documentation file is in index.html

notes: 
a) "plugins": ["plugins/markdown"] is used to mark the comments:
<b>This function ...<b> makes this line bold in the documentation

b) "source" "include" is where the source code situated
"exclude" doesn't include those folders for documentation
"includePattern" is what extensions are included (.js or jsx)
for TypeScript use ".+\\.ts(doc|x)?$"

c) "opts" "template" uses the docdash preinstalled theme to make it look better
"destination" is a folder name specified where the doc will be saved in the root of a project
"./documentation/developer" creates a folder and a subforlder for developer
user's documentation can also be created and pasted in a "./documentation/user" directory if you create one
